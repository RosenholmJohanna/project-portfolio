# project-portfolio

This week project was about creating your own portfolio using HTML and CSS to a set design to follow. 
This week Iâ€™ve been working some offline due technical issues and my work with the project is not yet fully finished. 
Left to do is to make the website 100% responsive, some styling and connect links to the project image.
